## Your challenge
Your challenge is to build out this multi-step form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use
any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. The only requirement is that the form should be functional,
meaning that users should be able to navigate between the different steps of the form and submit their information at
the end.
